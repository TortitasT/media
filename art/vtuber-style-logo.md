![vtuber style logo](./vtuber-style-logo.png)

I made this logo following a trend on twitter.

People were reimagining tech software logos like vscode in this style and I
wanted to try.

It was made in Affinity Designer 2, It was my first time using this program and I
really liked it. Specially due to their pricing model which at the moment is a one time
purchase.
