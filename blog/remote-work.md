Recently I left an office job at a local company to work for Indra as a remote
Vue software engineer.

This is my opinion on remote work after a few months of experience.

I remember many people telling me that remote would have it's drawbacks.

> "You'll miss your coworkers!"

> "That much time inside your house will be bad for you" 

Let me tell you I've never been happier.

I have more time to spend with my family, I can work from anywhere, and I can
even travel while working.

To address the first point, I still keep in touch with my coworkers. And
I don't believe the relationship you have with your coworkers should be
a reason to stay at a job.

As for the second point, I've been going out more than ever. I'm going
on trips around Europe, doing more exercise, and I've even started
programming on my free time again.

I'll add that I'm more productive than ever. I can focus on my work without
interruptions, and I can take breaks whenever I want to.

I'm not saying remote work is for everyone, but it's definitely for me.
