I finished this book on the plane back from Cinque Terre, Italy. Beautiful place!

It was an extremely interesting insight on how the Unix world was back then,
before Linux.

It remainded me that not everything is black and white, Linux has it's fair share of
problems and we shouldn't think less of anyone regardless of their software of choice.
